STATSPHERE - DASHBOARD PAGE
============================================================
File: frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js
URL: / (the home page)
============================================================

WHAT THIS PAGE DOES
--------------------
This is the home page of StatSphere. When a user opens
the app, this is the first thing they see.

It shows:
1. Live football matches happening right now
2. Quick stats (how many players, teams, etc.)
3. Links to other features in the app

HOW IT WORKS (STEP BY STEP)
-----------------------------
1. When the page loads, it calls the backend API:
   GET /api/live-matches

2. The backend reads the liveMatches.json file and sends
   the data back as JSON.

3. React stores the matches in a variable called "liveMatches"
   using useState().

4. The page shows each match in a card with:
   - The league name (e.g. "Premier League")
   - Home team vs Away team
   - The current score
   - What minute the match is at

5. There is a dropdown to filter matches by league.
   If the user picks "La Liga", only La Liga matches show.

KEY REACT CONCEPTS USED
-------------------------
- useState: Stores the live matches and the selected league filter
- useEffect: Runs the fetch() call when the page first loads
- .filter(): Filters the matches based on the selected league
- .map(): Loops through matches and creates a card for each one

DATA FORMAT (what liveMatches.json looks like)
-----------------------------------------------
[
  {
    "id": 101,
    "home": "Arsenal",
    "away": "Chelsea",
    "score": "1 - 2",
    "minute": "67'",
    "league": "Premier League"
  }
]

COMPLEX CODE EXPLAINED
------------------------

1. useEffect for Fetching Data
   When the Dashboard page first appears on screen, React runs a
   special block of code called useEffect. Inside it, we use fetch()
   to call the backend at /api/live-matches. This is like the page
   saying "Hey server, give me today's live matches!" The server
   replies with JSON data, and we store it in a variable using
   useState. The empty [] at the end of useEffect means "only do
   this once, when the page first loads" -- without it, the fetch
   would run over and over in an infinite loop.

2. League Filter Logic
   The user can pick a league from a dropdown (e.g. "Premier League").
   When they do, we save their choice in a useState variable called
   selectedLeague. Then we use JavaScript's .filter() method on the
   matches array: it goes through every match and only keeps the ones
   where match.league === selectedLeague. If the user picks "All",
   we skip the filter and show everything. This happens instantly
   because the data is already loaded -- no new API call is needed.

3. Conditional Rendering
   The page needs to handle different situations: data is still
   loading, no matches are happening right now, or matches exist.
   We use JavaScript's ternary operator (condition ? showThis :
   showThat) and && operator to decide what to display. For example:
   {loading ? <Spinner /> : matches.map(...)} means "if still
   loading, show a spinner; otherwise, show the match cards." This
   prevents the page from crashing or looking broken while waiting
   for data.

DEFENCE TALKING POINTS
------------------------

- "The Dashboard is the landing page because it gives users an
  immediate overview of what's happening in football right now.
  Good UX design means the first page should answer the user's
  most common question -- 'what's happening today?'"

- "I used useEffect with an empty dependency array to fetch data
  only once on page load. This is a core React pattern that
  prevents unnecessary API calls and keeps the app efficient."

- "The live matches feature simulates a real-time sports dashboard.
  In a production app, this could be connected to a live API like
  Football-Data.org, but I used mock data to demonstrate the
  architecture without depending on an external service."

- "The league filter works entirely on the frontend -- it doesn't
  make a new API call. This is called client-side filtering, and
  it makes the app feel fast and responsive because there's no
  network delay when the user changes the filter."

- "I chose a card-based layout for matches because it's a common
  UI pattern in sports apps like ESPN and FotMob. Each card shows
  just enough info (teams, score, minute) without overwhelming
  the user."
