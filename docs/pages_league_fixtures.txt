STATSPHERE - LEAGUE FIXTURES PAGE
============================================================
File: frontend/src/pages/LeagueFixtures.js
URL: /fixtures
============================================================

WHAT THIS PAGE DOES
--------------------
Shows upcoming and completed matches (fixtures) for any
competition. User can pick a league from the dropdown
and also filter by match status (All, Completed, Upcoming).

HOW IT WORKS (STEP BY STEP)
-----------------------------
1. Page loads with "Premier League" selected by default.

2. It calls the backend:
   GET /api/football/fixtures?competition=premier_league

3. The backend reads mockFixtures.json, finds fixtures for
   "Premier League", and sends them back.

4. React stores fixtures in a useState variable.

5. Each fixture is shown in a card with:
   - The round (e.g. "Matchday 1")
   - Home team vs Away team
   - The score (if match is completed)
   - Match status (Completed or Upcoming)
   - The date of the match

6. There is a STATUS FILTER dropdown:
   - All: Shows everything
   - Completed: Only shows finished matches
   - Upcoming: Only shows future matches

COMPETITION DROPDOWN
---------------------
Same as the Standings page. Split into groups:

  Domestic Leagues:
  - Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga,
    Ligue 1, Saudi Pro League

  Tournaments:
  - Champions League, World Cup 2026

STATUS FILTER
--------------
The user can filter by match status:
  - "All": No filter, show all matches
  - "FT" (Full Time): Show only completed matches
  - "NS" (Not Started): Show only upcoming matches

In code, this uses .filter():
  if (statusFilter === "All") show everything
  if (statusFilter === "FT") only show matches where status = "FT"
  if (statusFilter === "NS") only show matches where status = "NS"

DATA FORMAT (mockFixtures.json)
---------------------------------
{
  "Premier League": [
    {
      "id": 1001,
      "homeTeam": "Arsenal",
      "awayTeam": "Chelsea",
      "homeScore": 2,
      "awayScore": 1,
      "date": "2025-08-16",
      "status": "FT",
      "round": "Matchday 1"
    }
  ]
}

STATUS LABELS
--------------
FT = Full Time (match is over)
NS = Not Started (match is in the future)

These are shown as coloured badges on each fixture card:
  FT -> Green badge saying "Completed"
  NS -> Yellow badge saying "Upcoming"

KEY REACT CONCEPTS USED
-------------------------
- useState: Stores fixtures, selected competition, status filter
- useEffect: Fetches fixtures when competition changes
- .filter(): Filters fixtures by status
- .map(): Loops through fixtures to create cards

COMPLEX CODE EXPLAINED
------------------------

1. Status Filter (All / Finished / Scheduled)
   The page has a second dropdown for filtering by match status.
   The selected status is stored in a useState variable called
   statusFilter. When rendering, the fixtures array goes through
   .filter(): if statusFilter is "All", every match passes through;
   if it's "FT", only matches where fixture.status === "FT" are
   kept; if it's "NS", only future matches pass. This filter runs
   on the frontend (client-side) because all fixtures are already
   loaded -- no extra API call is needed. The filter combines with
   the competition dropdown, so you can see "only upcoming La Liga
   matches," for example.

2. Date Formatting
   The raw date in the JSON is stored as "2025-08-16" (ISO format),
   which isn't user-friendly. The code converts this into a
   readable format like "16 Aug 2025" using JavaScript's Date
   object and toLocaleDateString(). The steps are:
     const dateObj = new Date("2025-08-16")
     const formatted = dateObj.toLocaleDateString("en-GB",
       { day: "numeric", month: "short", year: "numeric" })
   This is important because different countries write dates
   differently (US: 08/16/2025 vs UK: 16/08/2025). Using
   toLocaleDateString with a locale ensures consistent formatting.

3. Competition Dropdown with Dynamic Fetch
   Like the Standings page, the competition dropdown triggers a new
   API call whenever the user picks a different league. The selected
   value is stored in useState, and useEffect watches it as a
   dependency. When it changes, useEffect fires a new fetch to
   GET /api/football/fixtures?competition=la_liga (or whichever
   league was picked). The old fixtures are replaced with the new
   ones, and the status filter resets to "All" so the user sees
   everything for the new league first.

DEFENCE TALKING POINTS
------------------------

- "Fixtures show both past results and upcoming matches, which is
  essential for a complete football app. Users want to know what
  happened last weekend and what's coming next -- this page serves
  both needs with a single interface."

- "The status filter lets users focus on what matters to them. A
  user checking results only cares about completed matches, while
  someone planning to watch a game only cares about upcoming ones.
  This is a practical UX feature that reduces information overload."

- "Date formatting seems simple but it's actually an important
  detail. Raw ISO dates like '2025-08-16' are not user-friendly.
  I used toLocaleDateString() to convert them into readable format,
  which shows attention to the user experience beyond just making
  things work."

- "The page supports 8 different competitions with the same code.
  I didn't build 8 separate pages -- one component handles all
  leagues by changing the API query parameter. This demonstrates
  code reusability and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle."

- "I reset the status filter to 'All' when the user switches
  leagues. This is a small UX detail that prevents confusion --
  if someone was viewing only completed Premier League matches and
  switches to La Liga, they should see all La Liga fixtures first,
  not an empty page because La Liga has no completed matches yet."
