STATSPHERE - RESPONSIVE DESIGN
============================================================
How the app works on all screen sizes
============================================================

WHAT IS RESPONSIVE DESIGN?
----------------------------
Responsive design means the website looks good on ALL devices:
- Mobile phones (small screens, ~375px wide)
- Tablets (medium screens, ~768px wide)
- Laptops/desktops (large screens, ~1024px+ wide)

We use Tailwind CSS breakpoints to change the layout
depending on screen size.

TAILWIND BREAKPOINTS
----------------------
Tailwind uses these size names:
  sm  = 640px and above  (large phones / small tablets)
  md  = 768px and above  (tablets)
  lg  = 1024px and above (laptops)
  xl  = 1280px and above (desktops)

HOW IT WORKS:
  "text-sm sm:text-base"
  This means: text is small by default, but becomes
  normal size on screens 640px and wider.

  "grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"
  This means: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on laptop.

NAVIGATION (HAMBURGER MENU)
------------------------------
File: App.js

On MOBILE (below 768px):
  - Only the logo and a hamburger icon (3 lines) show
  - Clicking the hamburger opens a dropdown menu
  - All page links are listed vertically
  - Login/logout options at the bottom

On DESKTOP (768px and above):
  - All page links show in a horizontal row
  - User info and logout button on the right
  - No hamburger icon needed

Code that controls this:
  "hidden md:flex"  = hidden on mobile, visible on desktop
  "md:hidden"       = visible on mobile, hidden on desktop
  menuOpen state    = true/false, toggles the mobile menu

KEY RESPONSIVE PATTERNS USED
-------------------------------

1. FLEXIBLE TEXT SIZES
   "text-sm sm:text-base" - smaller text on mobile
   "text-2xl sm:text-3xl" - smaller headings on mobile

2. FLEXIBLE GRIDS
   "grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2" - stack on mobile, side by side on tablet
   "grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4" - 2 columns mobile, 4 on desktop

3. FLEXIBLE LAYOUTS
   "flex-col sm:flex-row" - vertical on mobile, horizontal on desktop

4. HORIZONTAL SCROLL FOR TABLES
   "overflow-x-auto" - if table is too wide, user can scroll sideways

5. PADDING AND SPACING
   "p-3 sm:p-4 md:p-6" - less padding on mobile, more on desktop
   "px-2 sm:px-4" - less side padding on mobile

6. MAX WIDTH CONTAINERS
   "w-full max-w-6xl mx-auto" - content doesn't get too wide on big screens

7. RESPONSIVE IMAGES AND CHARTS
   ResponsiveContainer from Recharts automatically resizes charts
