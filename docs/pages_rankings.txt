WHAT THIS PAGE DOES
--------------------
Shows a FIFA-style ranking table for all 20 teams.
Each team gets an overall score based on their stats and
the difficulty of their league. Teams are sorted from
highest score to lowest (rank 1 = best team).

This is similar to how FIFA ranks national teams or how
Sofascore shows top teams, but simplified for our project.

============================================================
THE RANKING FORMULA
============================================================
  overallScore = (attack x 0.35) + (defense x 0.30)
               + (form x 0.20) + (leagueBonus x 0.15)

WHAT EACH PART MEANS:
  - attack (0-100): How good the team is at scoring goals
    Weight: 0.35 (35% of the score)
    This is the most important factor

  - defense (0-100): How good the team is at stopping goals
    Weight: 0.30 (30% of the score)

  - form (0-100): How well the team has been playing recently
    Weight: 0.20 (20% of the score)

  - leagueBonus: Extra points for playing in a harder league
    Weight: 0.15 (15% of the score)

============================================================
LEAGUE BONUS VALUES
============================================================
  Premier League:    15 points  (hardest league)
  La Liga:           13 points
  Serie A:           12 points
  Bundesliga:        12 points
  Ligue 1:           10 points
  Saudi Pro League:   6 points  (weakest league)

WHY LEAGUE BONUS MATTERS:
  If two teams both have 85 attack, but one plays in the
  Premier League and the other in the Saudi Pro League,
  the Premier League team gets a higher ranking because
  they face tougher opponents every week.

============================================================
EXAMPLE CALCULATION
============================================================
  Arsenal: attack=88, defense=89, form=88, league=PL (15)

  attackScore  = 88 x 0.35  = 30.8
  defenseScore = 89 x 0.30  = 26.7
  formScore    = 88 x 0.20  = 17.6
  leagueScore  = 15 x 0.15  =  2.25
  TOTAL = 30.8 + 26.7 + 17.6 + 2.25 = 77.35

  Al Nassr: attack=78, defense=72, form=74, league=Saudi (6)

  attackScore  = 78 x 0.35  = 27.3
  defenseScore = 72 x 0.30  = 21.6
  formScore    = 74 x 0.20  = 14.8
  leagueScore  = 6  x 0.15  =  0.9
  TOTAL = 27.3 + 21.6 + 14.8 + 0.9 = 64.6

  Arsenal (77.35) ranks higher than Al Nassr (64.6)
