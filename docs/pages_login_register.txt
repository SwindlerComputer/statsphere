STATSPHERE - LOGIN AND REGISTER PAGES
============================================================
Files: frontend/src/pages/Login.js
       frontend/src/pages/Register.js
URLs: /login and /register
============================================================

WHAT THESE PAGES DO
--------------------
Login: Lets existing users sign into their account.
Register: Lets new users create an account.

Both pages are forms with text inputs and a submit button.

HOW REGISTER WORKS (STEP BY STEP)
------------------------------------
1. User fills in: name, email, password

2. User clicks "Register"

3. Frontend sends a POST request to the backend:
   POST /api/auth/register
   Body: { name: "John", email: "john@email.com", password: "123" }

4. Backend receives the data:
   a. Checks if email already exists in the database
   b. If it does, sends back an error
   c. If it doesn't, hashes the password (scrambles it for safety)
   d. Saves the new user in the PostgreSQL database
   e. Creates a JWT token (a login pass)
   f. Sends the token back in a cookie

5. Frontend receives the response:
   a. If success, redirects to the Dashboard
   b. If error, shows the error message

HOW LOGIN WORKS (STEP BY STEP)
---------------------------------
1. User fills in: email, password

2. User clicks "Login"

3. Frontend sends a POST request:
   POST /api/auth/login
   Body: { email: "john@email.com", password: "123" }

4. Backend:
   a. Finds the user by email in the database
   b. Compares the password with the stored hash
   c. If they match, creates a JWT token
   d. Sends the token back in a cookie

5. Frontend receives the response and redirects to Dashboard.

JWT TOKENS EXPLAINED (SIMPLE VERSION)
----------------------------------------
JWT = JSON Web Token. It's like a digital ID card.

When you log in, the server gives you a token.
This token proves who you are.
Every time you visit a page or send a chat message,
your browser sends the token so the server knows it's you.

The token is stored in a cookie (a small file in your browser).
When you log out, the cookie is deleted.

See authentication_flow.txt for more details.

PASSWORD HASHING
------------------
We NEVER store passwords as plain text.
Instead, we use "bcrypt" to hash them.

Hashing means turning "password123" into something like:
  "$2b$10$xJKfY3kR.../..."

You can't reverse a hash back to the original password.
When logging in, we hash what the user typed and compare
the two hashes. If they match, the password is correct.

KEY REACT CONCEPTS USED
-------------------------
- useState: Stores form inputs (email, password, name)
- fetch: Sends data to the backend API
- useNavigate: Redirects user after login/register
