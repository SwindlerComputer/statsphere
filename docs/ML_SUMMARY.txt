ML_SUMMARY.txt — Ballon d'Or ML (Student Level)
===============================================

SIMPLE IDEA
-----------
We have 200 players with stats (goals, assists, etc.).
We use a rule to give each player a "Ballon d'Or score" (the label).
We train a simple model (RandomForest) to predict that score from the stats.
The app can then show "ML Ranking" using those predictions.

THREE STEPS (what we do)
------------------------
1. Export: Turn player JSON into a CSV with scores (so Python can read it).
2. Train: Python reads the CSV, splits 80% train / 20% test, trains RandomForest, saves the model.
3. Use: The website calls the backend; the backend either uses a pre-saved list of scores (on Render) or runs Python (on your PC).

FILES (what each one does)
--------------------------
  exportBallonDorTrainingData.js  → Reads players, adds a score, writes ballondor_train.csv
  train_ballondor.py              → Reads CSV, trains model, saves .pkl and meta.json
  predict_ballondor.py            → Reads model, gets players from stdin, prints scores as JSON
  ml_scores_precomputed.json      → Pre-saved scores for all 200 players (so the server doesn't need Python)
  server.js (ML part)             → Sends players to the backend; backend returns scores from the JSON file

HOW TO RUN (copy these)
-----------------------
  cd backend

  # Step 1 + 2: make CSV and train model
  npm run ml:ballondor

  # Step 3: save scores to a file (so the website can use them without Python)
  npm run generate:ml-scores

  # Start the server
  npm start

Then open the app, go to Ballon d'Or, and click "ML Ranking".

WHAT MAE AND R² MEAN (one sentence each)
-----------------------------------------
  MAE = On average, how many points wrong the model is. Lower is better.
  R²  = How much of the score variation the model explains (0 to 1). Higher is better.

KEY PATHS
---------
  CSV:   backend/data/ballondor_train.csv
  Model: backend/ml/model/ballondor_model.pkl
  Scores: backend/data/ml_scores_precomputed.json

DEPLOYMENT (Render)
-------------------
The server does NOT run Python. It only reads ml_scores_precomputed.json.
So you must run "npm run generate:ml-scores" on your PC, commit that JSON file, and push.
Then the ML toggle works on the live site.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
  "ML not available" or 500 error
    → Make sure ml_scores_precomputed.json exists in backend/data and is committed.

  "Model file not found" (when running generate:ml-scores)
    → Run npm run ml:ballondor first to create the .pkl file.

  "python not found"
    → Install Python 3 and add it to PATH. On Windows use "python", on Mac/Linux use "python3".

  "No module named 'sklearn'"
    → Run: pip install scikit-learn pandas joblib
