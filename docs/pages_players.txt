STATSPHERE - PLAYERS PAGE
============================================================
File: frontend/src/pages/Players.js
URL: /players
============================================================

WHAT THIS PAGE DOES
--------------------
Shows a table of all 200 players with their stats.
Users can search by name, filter by league, position,
or team. It uses PAGINATION so only 20 players show
at a time (not all 200 at once).

HOW IT WORKS (STEP BY STEP)
-----------------------------
1. When the page loads, it calls:
   GET /api/insights/players

2. The backend reads mockPlayers.json and sends back
   an array of 200 player objects.

3. React stores all 200 players in a variable called "players".

4. The user can type in the search box or pick from dropdowns.
   Every time they type or pick, the filter runs again.

5. The filter uses .filter() to check each player:
   - Does the name match the search text?
   - Does the position match the dropdown?
   - Does the team match the dropdown?
   - Does the league match the dropdown?
   Only players that pass ALL checks are shown.

6. PAGINATION: The filtered list is split into pages of 20.
   - slice(0, 20) = page 1
   - slice(20, 40) = page 2
   - etc.
   The user clicks "Next" or "Previous" to change pages.

KEY REACT CONCEPTS USED
-------------------------
- useState: Stores players, search text, filters, current page
- useEffect: Fetches players from backend on page load
- .filter(): Applies search and dropdown filters
- .slice(): Cuts the array to show only 20 players per page
- Math.ceil(): Calculates total number of pages

PAGINATION EXPLAINED (SIMPLE)
-------------------------------
Total players = 200
Players per page = 20
Total pages = 200 / 20 = 10 pages

If user is on page 3:
  startIndex = (3 - 1) * 20 = 40
  endIndex = 40 + 20 = 60
  Show players from index 40 to 59

When user clicks "Next":
  currentPage goes from 3 to 4
  New slice: players 60 to 79

When user changes a filter:
  currentPage resets back to 1
