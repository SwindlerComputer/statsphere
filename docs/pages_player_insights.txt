WHAT THIS PAGE DOES
--------------------
This is the most detailed page in the app. The user picks
a player and sees:
1. Their key stats in a card (goals, assists, passes, etc.)
2. A BAR CHART showing their main stats
3. A RADAR CHART showing their skill profile
4. An AI analysis showing STRENGTHS and WEAKNESSES

HOW IT WORKS (STEP BY STEP)
-----------------------------
1. Page loads and fetches all 200 players from:
   GET /api/insights/players

2. User can search and filter using dropdowns for
   position and team.

3. User picks a player from the dropdown.

4. When a player is picked:
   a. A stat card shows their key numbers
   b. A bar chart is drawn using Recharts library
   c. A radar chart is drawn showing their skill profile
   d. The rule-based system runs and shows strengths/weaknesses

CHARTS (RECHARTS LIBRARY)
--------------------------
We use a library called "Recharts" to draw charts.
It is already installed in the project (in package.json).

BAR CHART:
- Shows goals, assists, shots, key passes, dribbles, passes
- Each stat is a blue bar
- Taller bar = higher number

RADAR CHART:
- Shows 6 skills: Scoring, Passing, Dribbling, Defending,
  Creativity, Shooting
- Each skill is scored from 0 to 100
- The shape shows what the player is good at
- A big shape = good at everything
- A pointy shape = only good at some things

RULE-BASED SYSTEM (AI ANALYSIS)
---------------------------------
This is a simple form of artificial intelligence.
It uses IF/THEN rules to analyse each player.

How it works:
- Look at the player's stats
- Check each stat against a threshold (a number)
- If stat is above the threshold = STRENGTH
- If stat is below the threshold = WEAKNESS

Example rules:
  IF goals >= 20 THEN strength = "Elite Finisher"
  IF goals >= 12 THEN strength = "Clinical Scorer"
  IF forward AND goals < 5 THEN weakness = "Poor Goal Output"
  IF assists >= 12 THEN strength = "Elite Playmaker"
  IF tackles >= 80 THEN strength = "Defensive Wall"
  IF defender AND tackles < 40 THEN weakness = "Weak Defensively"
  IF rating >= 8.0 THEN strength = "World Class Rating"

The rules are position-aware:
- Forwards are expected to score more goals
- Defenders are expected to make more tackles
- Midfielders are expected to create more assists
