STATSPHERE - LOGIN & REGISTRATION SYSTEM

Files:
  Frontend: frontend/src/pages/Login.js

  Backend:  backend/auth/authRoutes.js

============================================================

REGISTRATION - HOW IT WORKS
------------------------------
1. User fills in: Username, Email, Password, Confirm Password

2. FRONTEND VALIDATION (before sending to server):
   - Username: 3-20 characters, letters/numbers/underscores only
   - Email: must contain @ and a domain (e.g. user@example.com)
   - Password must be at least 8 characters
   - Password must have at least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
   - Password must have at least 1 number (0-9)
   - Confirm Password must match Password

3. A PASSWORD STRENGTH BAR shows:
   - Weak (red):   only 1 requirement met
   - Fair (yellow): 2 requirements met
   - Good (blue):  3 requirements met
   - Strong (green): all 4 requirements met (8+ chars, uppercase, number, special char)

4. Frontend sends: POST /auth/register
   Body: { name, email, password }

5. BACKEND VALIDATION (double-checks everything):
   - Username 3-20 chars, only letters/numbers/underscores
   - Email format is valid
   - Password: 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number
   - Email not already registered
   - Username not already taken

6. Backend hashes the password using bcrypt
   "Password1" -> "$2b$10$xJKfY3kR..."
   (this scrambled version is stored in the database)

7. Backend saves user to PostgreSQL database

8. Backend creates a JWT token and sends it back
   as both a cookie and in the response body

LOGIN - HOW IT WORKS
----------------------
Users can log in with either EMAIL or USERNAME.

1. User types their email OR username + password

2. Frontend sends: POST /auth/login
   Body: { email: "input", password: "..." }
   (the "email" field can contain an email or username)

3. Backend checks if the input contains "@":
   - If YES: looks up user by email
   - If NO:  looks up user by username

   Code:
   if (loginInput.includes("@")) {
     result = pool.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email=$1")
   } else {
     result = pool.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=$1")
   }

4. Backend compares password using bcrypt
   bcrypt.compare("typed password", "stored hash")

5. If match: creates JWT token, sends it back
   If no match: returns "Invalid credentials"

KEY VARIABLES (Register.js)
------------------------------
  name             - the username they typed
  email            - the email they typed
  password         - the password they typed
  confirmPassword  - the confirm password field
  showPassword     - toggle to show/hide password text
  msg              - error or success message
  isSuccess        - true if registration worked

KEY VARIABLES (Login.js)
--------------------------
  loginInput   - whatever the user typed (email or username)
  password     - the password they typed
  showPassword - toggle to show/hide password
  msg          - error or success message

PASSWORD STRENGTH FUNCTION
----------------------------
function getPasswordStrength():
  score = 0
  if length >= 8:  score + 1
  if has uppercase: score + 1
  if has number:    score + 1
  if has special:   score + 1

  score 0-1: Weak (red bar, 25%)
  score 2:   Fair (yellow bar, 50%)
  score 3:   Good (blue bar, 75%)
  score 4:   Strong (green bar, 100%)

JWT TOKENS EXPLAINED
----------------------
JWT = JSON Web Token. Its like a digital ID card.
When you log in, the server gives you a token.
This token is stored in a cookie AND localStorage.
Every time you visit a page, the token proves who you are.
Token expires after 7 days (the user has to log in again).
