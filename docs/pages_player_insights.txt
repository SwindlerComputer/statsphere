STATSPHERE - PLAYER INSIGHTS PAGE

WHAT THIS PAGE DOES
--------------------
This is the most detailed page in the app. The user picks
a player and sees:
1. Their key stats in a card (goals, assists, passes, etc.)
2. A BAR CHART showing their main stats
3. A RADAR CHART showing their skill profile
4. An AI analysis showing STRENGTHS and WEAKNESSES

HOW IT WORKS (STEP BY STEP)
-----------------------------
1. Page loads and fetches all 200 players from:
   GET /api/insights/players

2. User can search and filter using dropdowns for
   position and team.

3. User picks a player from the dropdown.

4. When a player is picked:
   a. A stat card shows their key numbers
   b. A bar chart is drawn using Recharts library
   c. A radar chart is drawn showing their skill profile
   d. The rule-based system runs and shows strengths/weaknesses

CHARTS (RECHARTS LIBRARY)
--------------------------
We use a library called "Recharts" to draw charts.
It is already installed in the project (in package.json).

BAR CHART:
- Shows goals, assists, shots, key passes, dribbles, passes
- Each stat is a blue bar
- Taller bar = higher number

RADAR CHART:
- Shows 6 skills: Scoring, Passing, Dribbling, Defending,
  Creativity, Shooting
- Each skill is scored from 0 to 100
- The shape shows what the player is good at
- A big shape = good at everything
- A pointy shape = only good at some things

RULE-BASED SYSTEM (AI ANALYSIS)
---------------------------------
This is a simple form of artificial intelligence.
It uses IF/THEN rules to analyse each player.

How it works:
- Look at the player's stats
- Check each stat against a threshold (a number)
- If stat is above the threshold = STRENGTH
- If stat is below the threshold = WEAKNESS

Example rules:
  IF goals >= 20 THEN strength = "Elite Finisher"
  IF goals >= 12 THEN strength = "Clinical Scorer"
  IF forward AND goals < 5 THEN weakness = "Poor Goal Output"
  IF assists >= 12 THEN strength = "Elite Playmaker"
  IF tackles >= 80 THEN strength = "Defensive Wall"
  IF defender AND tackles < 40 THEN weakness = "Weak Defensively"
  IF rating >= 8.0 THEN strength = "World Class Rating"

The rules are position-aware:
- Forwards are expected to score more goals
- Defenders are expected to make more tackles
- Midfielders are expected to create more assists

COMPLEX CODE EXPLAINED
------------------------

1. Recharts Integration (BarChart and RadarChart)
   Recharts is a React charting library. Instead of drawing charts
   manually with canvas or SVG, we use pre-built components like
   <BarChart>, <Bar>, <RadarChart>, and <Radar>. We pass the
   player's stats as a "data" array -- for example:
     [{ name: "Goals", value: 25 }, { name: "Assists", value: 12 }]
   Recharts reads this array and draws the bars or radar shape
   automatically. The RadarChart is especially useful because it
   shows multiple skills at once in a spider-web shape -- a big
   shape means the player is well-rounded, a pointy shape means
   they excel in only a few areas.

2. Rule-Based Analysis (if/else for Strengths and Weaknesses)
   The "AI analysis" is actually a series of if/else statements
   that check each player's stats against thresholds. For example:
     if (player.goals >= 20) strengths.push("Elite Finisher")
     if (player.position === "Forward" && player.goals < 5)
       weaknesses.push("Poor Goal Output")
   The system is "position-aware" -- a defender with 3 goals is
   fine, but a forward with 3 goals is a weakness. Each rule is
   simple on its own, but together they create a detailed profile.
   This is a real AI technique called a "rule-based expert system."

3. Player Selection Dropdown
   The dropdown is not a basic HTML <select>. It's a searchable
   dropdown: users can type a name and the list filters in real
   time. When a player is selected, their ID is stored in state
   using useState, and the entire page re-renders with that
   player's data -- the stat card updates, charts redraw, and
   the rule-based analysis runs again. This all happens because
   React re-renders components whenever state changes.

DEFENCE TALKING POINTS
------------------------

- "I used Recharts because it integrates natively with React. Unlike
  Chart.js which manipulates the DOM directly, Recharts uses React
  components, which means the charts update automatically when the
  data changes. This is the right tool choice for a React project."

- "The radar chart is particularly effective for player analysis
  because it lets you see a player's complete skill profile at a
  glance. Scouts and analysts in real football use radar charts --
  websites like FBref and StatsBomb use this exact visualisation."

- "The rule-based system is a legitimate form of AI. It's called a
  rule-based expert system, and it's used in real applications like
  medical diagnosis tools. My system has rules that are position-
  aware, so it evaluates forwards differently from defenders."

- "I chose to combine data (stats card), visualisation (charts),
  and analysis (strengths/weaknesses) on one page because it gives
  the user a complete picture without navigating away. This follows
  the dashboard design principle of 'details on demand.'"

- "The strengths and weaknesses are generated dynamically -- they
  change based on the selected player. This means the system works
  for all 200 players without any hardcoded text, which demonstrates
  scalability."
