STATSPHERE - RESPONSIVE DESIGN
============================================================
How the app works on all screen sizes
============================================================

WHAT IS RESPONSIVE DESIGN?
----------------------------
Responsive design means the website looks good on ALL devices:
- Mobile phones (small screens, ~375px wide)
- Tablets (medium screens, ~768px wide)
- Laptops/desktops (large screens, ~1024px+ wide)

We use Tailwind CSS breakpoints to change the layout
depending on screen size.

TAILWIND BREAKPOINTS
----------------------
Tailwind uses these size names:
  sm  = 640px and above  (large phones / small tablets)
  md  = 768px and above  (tablets)
  lg  = 1024px and above (laptops)
  xl  = 1280px and above (desktops)

HOW IT WORKS:
  "text-sm sm:text-base"
  This means: text is small by default, but becomes
  normal size on screens 640px and wider.

  "grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"
  This means: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on laptop.

NAVIGATION (HAMBURGER MENU)
------------------------------
File: App.js

On MOBILE (below 768px):
  - Only the logo and a hamburger icon (3 lines) show
  - Clicking the hamburger opens a dropdown menu
  - All page links are listed vertically
  - Login/logout options at the bottom

On DESKTOP (768px and above):
  - All page links show in a horizontal row
  - User info and logout button on the right
  - No hamburger icon needed

Code that controls this:
  "hidden md:flex"  = hidden on mobile, visible on desktop
  "md:hidden"       = visible on mobile, hidden on desktop
  menuOpen state    = true/false, toggles the mobile menu

KEY RESPONSIVE PATTERNS USED
-------------------------------

1. FLEXIBLE TEXT SIZES
   "text-sm sm:text-base" - smaller text on mobile
   "text-2xl sm:text-3xl" - smaller headings on mobile

2. FLEXIBLE GRIDS
   "grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2" - stack on mobile, side by side on tablet
   "grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4" - 2 columns mobile, 4 on desktop

3. FLEXIBLE LAYOUTS
   "flex-col sm:flex-row" - vertical on mobile, horizontal on desktop

4. HORIZONTAL SCROLL FOR TABLES
   "overflow-x-auto" - if table is too wide, user can scroll sideways

5. PADDING AND SPACING
   "p-3 sm:p-4 md:p-6" - less padding on mobile, more on desktop
   "px-2 sm:px-4" - less side padding on mobile

6. MAX WIDTH CONTAINERS
   "w-full max-w-6xl mx-auto" - content doesn't get too wide on big screens

7. RESPONSIVE IMAGES AND CHARTS
   ResponsiveContainer from Recharts automatically resizes charts

PAGES AND THEIR RESPONSIVE FEATURES
---------------------------------------
Dashboard:      1-col mobile, 2-col tablet for match cards
Players:        Table with overflow-x-auto, smaller text on mobile
PlayerInsights: Charts resize automatically, 1-col mobile, 2-col desktop
Comparison:     Stack vertically on mobile, side by side on desktop
Ballon d'Or:    Cards adapt to screen width
Predictions:    Dropdowns go full width on mobile
Standings:      Table scrolls horizontally on mobile
Fixtures:       1-col mobile, 2-col tablet
Community:      Shorter chat box on mobile (h-80 vs h-96)
Login/Register: Full width on mobile, max-w-md on desktop
Profile:        Single column, full width on all sizes

COMPLEX CODE EXPLAINED
------------------------
Here are the trickiest parts of responsive design in this project:

1. Tailwind Breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg: prefixes)
   Tailwind uses a mobile-first approach. When you write "text-sm
   sm:text-base", it means: "By default (on mobile), use small text.
   But on screens 640px and wider, use base-size text." The prefix
   before the colon is the breakpoint. Everything WITHOUT a prefix
   applies to all screens (starting from mobile). Prefixed styles only
   kick in when the screen reaches that width. This means you design
   for mobile first and then add styles for larger screens on top.

2. Hamburger Menu Toggle
   The navigation bar has two versions: a horizontal link bar for
   desktop and a dropdown menu for mobile. The state variable "menuOpen"
   (true/false) controls whether the mobile dropdown is visible. Clicking
   the hamburger icon toggles menuOpen. The CSS class "hidden md:flex"
   hides the desktop nav on mobile and shows it on medium+ screens.
   The class "md:hidden" does the opposite - shows the hamburger icon
   only on mobile. This pattern is how almost every modern website
   handles navigation on small screens.

3. Grid Responsive Columns
   The class "grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3" creates a grid
   layout that adapts to the screen. On mobile (default), items stack
   in 1 column. On small screens (640px+), they arrange into 2 columns.
   On large screens (1024px+), they spread across 3 columns. The grid
   automatically handles spacing and sizing. This is used throughout the
   app for match cards, player cards, and other repeating content. It
   replaces complex CSS calculations with simple, readable class names.

DEFENCE TALKING POINTS
------------------------
Here is what to say when presenting responsive design:

- "The entire application is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and
  desktop screen sizes. I used Tailwind CSS's mobile-first breakpoint
  system, which means I designed for mobile first and progressively
  enhanced the layout for larger screens."

- "Tailwind CSS makes responsive design efficient because instead of
  writing separate CSS media queries, I apply responsive prefixes
  directly in the HTML. For example, 'grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2'
  instantly makes a layout that stacks on mobile and goes side-by-side
  on tablet."

- "I implemented a hamburger menu for mobile navigation that toggles
  with React state. On desktop, the full navigation bar is visible.
  On mobile, it collapses into an icon that expands into a dropdown.
  This is the standard navigation pattern used across professional
  web applications."

- "I tested the application on multiple screen sizes including mobile
  (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px+) to make sure every
  page looks good and functions correctly on all devices."

- "Key responsive patterns I used include flexible grids, responsive
  text sizing, overflow scrolling for wide tables, and adaptive padding.
  These ensure content is always readable and well-spaced regardless
  of the screen size."
