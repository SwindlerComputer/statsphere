STATSPHERE - COMMUNITY CHAT PAGE
============================================================
File: frontend/src/pages/Community.js
URL: /community
============================================================

WHAT THIS PAGE DOES
--------------------
This is a real-time chat page where logged-in users can
talk to each other. Messages appear instantly (no need to
refresh the page) because we use WebSockets.

HOW IT WORKS (STEP BY STEP)
-----------------------------
1. User must be logged in to use the chat.
   If not logged in, they see a message saying
   "Please log in to join the community chat."

2. When the page loads, it connects to the backend
   using Socket.IO (a WebSocket library).

3. When the user types a message and clicks "Send":
   a. The message is sent to the backend via WebSocket
   b. The backend receives it
   c. The backend checks for bad words (moderation)
   d. The backend sends the message to ALL connected users
   e. Everyone's chat updates instantly

4. Messages appear in a scrollable list with:
   - The sender's name
   - The message text
   - The time it was sent

WEBSOCKETS vs NORMAL HTTP
---------------------------
Normal HTTP (what we use for other pages):
  - Client asks server for data (request)
  - Server sends data back (response)
  - Connection closes
  - Client has to ask again to get updates

WebSocket (what we use for chat):
  - Client connects to server (stays connected)
  - Server can send data to client at ANY TIME
  - Client can send data to server at ANY TIME
  - Perfect for chat because messages appear instantly

SOCKET.IO EXPLAINED
---------------------
Socket.IO is a library that makes WebSockets easy to use.

Backend (server.js):
  const io = require("socket.io")(server)
  io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    socket.on("chat-message", (msg) => {
      io.emit("chat-message", msg)
    })
  })

Frontend (Community.js):
  import io from "socket.io-client"
  const socket = io(API_BASE)
  socket.on("chat-message", (msg) => {
    // add message to the chat list
  })

The key events:
  "connection": A user has joined the chat
  "chat-message": A new message was sent
  "disconnect": A user left the chat

MODERATION SYSTEM
-------------------
Before a message is sent to everyone, the backend checks it.
If the message contains a bad word, it gets blocked.

The system also allows users to "report" a message.
If a message gets enough reports, it can be reviewed
by an admin.

See moderation_system.txt for more details.

KEY REACT CONCEPTS USED
-------------------------
- useState: Stores messages, input text
- useEffect: Connects to WebSocket when page loads
- useRef: Scrolls chat to the bottom when new messages arrive
