WHAT THIS PAGE DOES
--------------------
This page predicts who should win the Ballon d'Or award.
It loads all 200 players, gives each one a score based on
their stats, then shows ONLY the top 10 candidates.

The player with the highest score is ranked #1.

HOW IT WORKS (STEP BY STEP)
-----------------------------
1. Page loads and fetches all 200 players from:
   GET /api/insights/players

2. For each player, it runs the calculateScore() function
   to give them a number.

3. It sorts all 200 players by score (highest first).

4. It uses .slice(0, 10) to keep only the top 10.

5. It shows these 10 players in cards with their stats.

6. At the bottom, there is a breakdown showing WHY
   the #1 player got the highest score.

THE SCORING FORMULA
---------------------
For each player, the score is calculated like this:

  Step 1: Calculate goal points   = goals x 4
  Step 2: Calculate assist points = assists x 3
  Step 3: Calculate rating points = rating x 10
  Step 4: Calculate creativity    = keyPasses x 0.5
  Step 5: Calculate consistency   = (goals / minutesPlayed x 90) x 50
  Step 6: Add them all together   = rawScore
  Step 7: Multiply by league weight = finalScore

Example with Kylian Mbappe (made up numbers):
  Goals: 25     -> 25 x 4 = 100 points
  Assists: 10   -> 10 x 3 = 30 points
  Rating: 8.2   -> 8.2 x 10 = 82 points
  Key Passes: 60 -> 60 x 0.5 = 30 points
  Goals/90: 0.8  -> 0.8 x 50 = 40 points
  Raw Score = 100 + 30 + 82 + 30 + 40 = 282
  League Weight (La Liga) = 0.95
  Final Score = 282 x 0.95 = 267.9

LEAGUE WEIGHTS EXPLAINED
--------------------------
Not all leagues are equally hard. Scoring 20 goals in the
Premier League is harder than scoring 20 in a weaker league.
So we multiply the score by a weight:

  Premier League: 1.0   (100% - hardest)
  La Liga:        0.95  (95%)
  Serie A:        0.9   (90%)
  Bundesliga:     0.9   (90%)
  Ligue 1:        0.85  (85%)
  Super Lig:      0.75  (75%)
  Saudi Pro League: 0.7 (70%)

WHY ONLY TOP 10?
-----------------
The Ballon d'Or award only goes to the best players in the
world. Showing all 200 players would be confusing and would
make the page slow. By showing only the top 10, it looks
clean and makes sense (like the real award shortlist).

KEY REACT CONCEPTS USED
-------------------------
- useState: Stores top10 array and loading state
- useEffect: Fetches players and calculates scores on load
- .sort(): Sorts players by score (highest first)
- .slice(0, 10): Takes only the first 10 from sorted array
- .map(): Loops through top 10 to create cards
