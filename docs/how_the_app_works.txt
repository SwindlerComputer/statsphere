STATSPHERE - HOW THE WHOLE APP WORKS
============================================================
A simple overview for your final year project defence
============================================================

WHAT IS STATSPHERE?
--------------------
StatSphere is a football analytics web application.
It lets users view player stats, compare players,
predict match outcomes, see league tables, and chat
with other users in real time.

THE THREE MAIN PARTS
----------------------
The app has 3 main parts that work together:

1. FRONTEND (what the user sees)
   - Built with React.js
   - Styled with Tailwind CSS
   - Charts drawn with Recharts library
   - Runs in the browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
   - Hosted on Vercel

2. BACKEND (the server)
   - Built with Node.js + Express.js
   - Reads mock data from JSON files
   - Handles login/register with JWT
   - Runs the WebSocket chat server
   - Hosted on Render

3. DATABASE (stores user accounts)
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Hosted on Supabase
   - Stores: users, chat messages, reports

HOW THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER
------------------------------
Frontend <----> Backend <----> Database

1. User opens the app in their browser (Frontend)
2. Frontend sends a request to the Backend
   Example: GET /api/insights/players
3. Backend reads the JSON file or database
4. Backend sends the data back to Frontend
5. Frontend shows the data on the page

ALL THE PAGES IN THE APP
--------------------------

Page              URL             What it does
-----             ---             ------------

THE MOCK DATA
--------------
Instead of calling external APIs (which cost money and can
break), we use local JSON files with realistic data:

  backend/data/mockPlayers.json    - 200 real players with stats
  backend/data/mockTeams.json      - 21 teams across 7 leagues
  backend/data/mockStandings.json  - League tables for 8 competitions
  backend/data/mockFixtures.json   - Match fixtures for 8 competitions
  backend/data/liveMatches.json    - Simulated live matches
  backend/data/predictionTeams.json - Team ratings for predictions

All players are real 2025-26 players on their actual teams.

KEY TECHNOLOGIES
------------------
React.js     - Frontend framework (builds the pages)
Express.js   - Backend framework (handles API requests)
PostgreSQL   - Database (stores users and messages)
Socket.IO    - WebSocket library (real-time chat)
JWT          - Authentication (login tokens)
Recharts     - Chart library (bar charts, radar charts)
Tailwind CSS - CSS framework (styling)
Bcrypt       - Password hashing (security)
