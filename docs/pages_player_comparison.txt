WHAT THIS PAGE DOES
--------------------
Lets the user pick two players and compare them side by side.
The better stat is highlighted in green so you can easily see
who is better at what.

HOW IT WORKS (STEP BY STEP)
-----------------------------
1. Page loads and fetches all 200 players from:
   GET /api/insights/players

2. There are two dropdowns: Player A and Player B.
   Each dropdown has a search box so the user can type
   a name to find a player quickly.

3. When both players are picked, a comparison table appears.

4. Each stat is shown in a row:
   - Player A's value on the left
   - Stat name in the middle
   - Player B's value on the right
   - The HIGHER value is coloured GREEN

5. Each player also gets a "playstyle" label like:
   - "Clinical Finisher" (scores a lot efficiently)
   - "Creative Playmaker" (lots of assists and key passes)
   - "Defensive Rock" (lots of tackles and interceptions)
   - "Box-to-Box Midfielder" (default for midfielders)

STATS COMPARED
---------------
Basic Info: Age, Position, League, Rating
Attacking: Goals, Assists, Shots, Shots on Target, Key Passes, Dribbles
Defensive: Passes, Tackles, Interceptions, Clean Sheets
Discipline: Yellow Cards, Red Cards, Minutes Played

THE compareStats FUNCTION
--------------------------
This is a simple function:
  function compareStats(valueA, valueB)
    if valueA > valueB: return "A"
    if valueB > valueA: return "B"
    else: return "tie"

If it returns "A", Player A's number turns green.
If it returns "B", Player B's number turns green.

THE getPlaystyle FUNCTION
--------------------------
This checks a player's stats and returns a label:
  IF goals >= 15 AND shot accuracy > 15% = "Clinical Finisher"
  IF assists >= 10 AND key passes >= 40 = "Creative Playmaker"
  IF tackles >= 70 AND interceptions >= 50 = "Defensive Rock"
  IF dribbles >= 60 AND goals >= 8 = "Skillful Attacker"
  Otherwise: use a default based on their position

COMPLEX CODE EXPLAINED
------------------------

1. Two-Player Selection System
   The page has two separate dropdown variables (playerA and
   playerB), each stored with useState. When both are selected,
   the comparison table appears. The code checks: if (playerA &&
   playerB) then show the table, otherwise show a message asking
   the user to pick both players. Each dropdown filters the full
   200-player list independently, so you can search by name in
   either one. The key detail: both dropdowns share the same
   player data, but they store their selection separately so
   picking Player A doesn't affect Player B.

2. Side-by-Side Stat Comparison with Highlighting
   For every stat row, we call compareStats(valueA, valueB). This
   function returns "A", "B", or "tie". The JSX then uses this
   result to set the CSS class: if result is "A", Player A's cell
   gets a green background (className="highlight-win"), and Player
   B's cell stays normal. This is done with a ternary operator:
     className={result === "A" ? "highlight-win" : ""}
   The green highlighting is what makes the comparison instantly
   readable -- your eye goes straight to who's better at each stat.

3. getPlaystyle Function Logic
   This function takes a player's stats and returns a text label
   like "Clinical Finisher". It works with a chain of if/else
   statements checking multiple conditions at once:
     if (goals >= 15 AND shotAccuracy > 15%) return "Clinical Finisher"
     if (assists >= 10 AND keyPasses >= 40) return "Creative Playmaker"
   The conditions are checked in order from most specific to most
   general. If no specific condition matches, a default label is
   assigned based on the player's position (e.g. all remaining
   midfielders become "Box-to-Box Midfielder"). This gives every
   player a meaningful label.

DEFENCE TALKING POINTS
------------------------

- "The comparison feature is inspired by real scouting tools used
  in professional football. Websites like FBref and Transfermarkt
  offer similar comparisons. It helps users make informed judgments
  about which player is stronger in specific areas."

- "I compare 15+ different stats across four categories: basic info,
  attacking, defensive, and discipline. This comprehensive approach
  means users can evaluate players from every angle, not just goals
  and assists."

- "The green highlighting uses conditional CSS classes, which is a
  fundamental React pattern. It makes the data instantly readable --
  users don't need to compare numbers manually because the visual
  cue tells them immediately who's better."

- "The playstyle detection function is a form of classification --
  it categorises players into types based on their statistical
  profile. This adds an extra layer of insight beyond raw numbers
  and helps users understand what role a player fills."

- "Both dropdowns share the same data source but maintain independent
  state. This demonstrates good React state management -- I didn't
  duplicate the data, I just used two separate useState variables
  pointing to different selections from the same array."
